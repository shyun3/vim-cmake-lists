USAGE                                                           *cmake-lists*

                                                 *:CMakeLists* *:CMakeLists!*
:CMakeLists[!] [directory]
  If no argument is given, open the CMakeLists.txt file of the currently
  selected buffer's directory. Any given directory may be an absolute or a
  relative path. Note that relative paths will be interpreted relative to the
  currently selected buffer's directory, not the current working directory.

  Providing a ! will always edit a CMakeLists.txt file for the given directory,
  assuming that the currently selected buffer's directory is valid.

gf
  Open the CMakeLists.txt file for the directory under or after the cursor.
  Directories may be either absolute or relative.
